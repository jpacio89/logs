[v1]

1. Multirotor:
    HeavyLifter Archs: circa 200-400 W/kg (hover gets circa 30%-40% of that)
    Burstable Archs: circa 500-1000 W/kg (hover get circa 10%-15% of that)

2. Nuclear Power Source (Pu-238 | Sr-90 | Po-210):
    Pu-238 mais promissor
        Power Output: circa 560 W/kg
        Halflife: 87.7 anos
        Decay: purely alpha (no beta or neutron decay)
        Risks: mostly internal
    Po-210 muito perigoso
        Power Output: circa 140 kW/kg
        Halflife: 138 days
        Decay: alpha
        Risk: external gamma negligeable but huge internal risk due to tendency to produce powders and vapours
    Sr-90 segunda opcao
        Power Output: 930 W/kg
        Halflife: 28.8 anos
        Decay: beta
        Risk: skin close-in due to beta particles

WARNING: DON'T FORGET THAT IMPURITIES MAY COMPLETELY WORSEN RISK PROFILE

3. Electric Engines & Instrumentation:
    LiPo
        High-rate
        Continuous circa 2-6 kW/kg
        Burst circa 6-15 kW/kg
        Energy density circa 120-200 Wh/kg
    Li-ion
        18650/21700 long-range packs
        Continuous circa 0.8-2.5 kW/kg
        Burst circa 3-6 kW/kg
        Energy density circa 200-260 Wh/kg
